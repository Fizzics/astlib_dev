EXAMPLES README
---------------

Most of the examples scripts in this directory will not run "out of the box",
because they need data (e.g. images) that are not included in this archive - 
for reasons of both the space they would take up, and the fact that I doubt
very much that I would legally be able to distribute them in any case.

Scripts that will run with no modifications/external data are:

* NEDQueryPlot - this downloads a DSS image from SkyView and overplots
                 labelled objects found using a NED query.
